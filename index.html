<h1><b><center>Mental Health</h1></b></center>
<p> Mental health is about how we feel and think. It's like being emotionally and mentally okay. When our mental health is good, we can handle stress, connect with others, and enjoy life. It's not just about avoiding problems but having a positive mind and dealing well with challenges. Taking care of our mental health is as important as taking care of our bodies.  </p>

<p> These websites will go over the basics of some of the mental health issues people have to deal with. They will also include things such as ways to avoid these issues and also ways to deal with them.
