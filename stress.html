<h1><b><u>What is Stress?</h1></b></u>
<p>
Stress is a regular part of life when things get tough or busy. It's like your body's way of reacting to challenges. It can come from work, relationships, or unexpected stuff. A little stress can be okay and might even help you focus, but too much or for a long time can make you feel not so great. You might get tense, irritated, or have trouble sleeping.

When you're stressed, it helps to take breaks and do things that make you feel calm, like deep breathing or relaxing activities. Break down big tasks into smaller steps to make them easier. Talk to someone you trust about what's stressing youâ€”it can make you feel better. Doing things you enjoy, like playing or exercising, can also help. If stress keeps bothering you, it's okay to ask for help from a counselor or someone you feel comfortable talking to. Finding what makes you feel better might take some time, so be patient with yourself.

Stress is when you feel pressure or challenges, like having a lot to do. It's usually temporary and goes away when things get easier. Anxiety is when you worry a lot about what might happen in the future, even when there's no clear reason to be scared. It's a more ongoing feeling that can stick around. Both stress and anxiety can affect your body and mind.
